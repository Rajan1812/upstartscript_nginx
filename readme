The "main" file can be use to execute a certaind command on upstart.
Steps:-

> create a file "myprogram.conf" in the /etc/init/
> add the content of main file into the /etc/init/myprogram.conf (with desired modification)
> Create a soft link of the file to /etc/init.d (without the extension)
      $ln -s /etc/init/myprogram.conf /etc/init.d/myprogram   
Now you can start your program with as a service
      $service myprogram start
      $service myprogram stop

Note we can calso check if the syntax for the upstart script is correct using the below command
      $init-checkconf myprogram.conf
